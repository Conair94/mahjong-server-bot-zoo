## 2026-05-25

Memory set scanned: `/Users/connorlockhart/.claude/projects/-Users-connorlockhart-Documents-GitHub-mahjong-server-bot-zoo/memory/` (19 files, 24 entries via MEMORY.md index)

Finding counts: STALE: 2, CONTRADICT: 0, MERGE: 0, DATE_FIX: 0

Stale entries:
1. `project_layer8_roadmap.md` — frames themes 1–4 (multi-hand, multi-table, auth, persistence) as future work; all landed in steps 8.0–8.4 by 2026-05-25. Needs a status header.
2. `project_layer8_status.md` — resumption checklist says "3 deselected"; actual is "2 skipped (Linux-only) + 1 deselected (slow)". Minor label mismatch, count 597 is correct.

All other entries verified clean: 15 file paths, 12 function/class names, 3 count/version references, 4 behavioral patterns — all current.

Frequently moved paths to watch: none yet. Paths that moved in this codebase history: `WebOrchestrator` stayed in `mahjong/web/server.py`; `MultiTableOrchestrator` is NEW in `mahjong/server/orchestrator.py` (8.4). `TableHandle`/`TableRegistry` are NEW in `mahjong/server/registry.py` (8.4).

Pattern noted: project status memories (layer6, layer7, layer8) are written at completion and remain accurate. Roadmap memories (layer8_roadmap) are written before implementation and go stale fast as steps land — always cross-check against the corresponding status memory.
